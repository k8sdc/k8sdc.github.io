aka Kubernetes Datacenter, provides a set of curated open source productivity, development and infrastructure Products.  These Products are integrated and secured \"out of the box\" with management provided by Kubernetes, Helm and Ansible.Purposek8sdc attempts to provide an entire set of integrated IT Capabilities that can be stood up rapidly and with little to no cost (dependant on where k8sdc is hosted).  The provided Capabilities can be categorised into the following areas.Management of a business with productivity Products.\n\nDevelopment and hosting of digital content with development and infrastructure Products.\n\nThe intention is to give small / medium and non-profit organisations the ability to easily stand up an infrastructure that rivals the Capabilities of an enterprise, thus freeing them to focus their resources on providing business value.Overviewk8sdc has Capabilities that are realised through Solutions.  These Solutions are implemented by Products with a relevant configuration.  Each Capability can potentially have multiple Solutions, leaving the choice of which to use up to the end user.The k8sdc platform has a number of Providers that allow it to be deployed to various cloud providers or on bare metal.TopologyDetails about the k8sdc topology can be found here.InstallationDetails about how to install k8sdc can be found here.RoadmapDetails of the k8sdc roadmap can be found here."},"k8sdc/topology.html":{"url":"k8sdc/topology.html","title":"Topology","keywords":"","body":"TopologyThe k8sdc topology is comprised of both a base topology for the platform components and a topology for each of the Solutions.Base TopologyThe components that make up the k8sdc base topology are shown in the following diagram and described in the table beneath.\n\nName\nDescription\n\nAnsible Host\nThe Ansible Host is used to install, manage and update the k8sdc base components.\nKubernetes Masters\nThe Kubernetes Masters manage the Kubernetes cluster.\nKubernetes Nodes\nThe Kubernetes Nodes run the workloads.\nFileserver\nThe Fileserver is used to download the installation media for the k8sdc base components.\nImage Registry Mirror\nThe Image Registry Mirror is used to cache pulled Docker images.  This greatly improves performance for Kubernetes Nodes when using previously pulled images.\nCA\nThe CA (Certificate Authority) is used to generate the private keys and certificates for the k8sdc base components and the k8sdc Solutions.\nNTP Server\nThe NTP Server is used by the k8sdc nodes to synchronise the time and date.

The k8sdc command allows for all Providers to have a similar method of installation.Test environmentk8sdc is a new project and is still considered experimental.  As such testing has only been conducted on a limited set of environments.  The following software versions are known to work.macOS 10.12\n\nPython 2.7.12\n\nAnsible 2.1.2.0 (must be this version as 2.2 breaks certificate generation)\n\nVagrant 1.8.4\n\nVirtualbox 5.0.26 r108824\n\nInstall the k8sdc commandThe k8sdc command is implemented using Python.  It can be installed using pip.NoteIt is probably best to use a seperate Virtualenv or Pyenv environment.$ pip install k8sdc\nThe following dependancies will be installed along with k8sdc.ansible>=2.1.2.0\ndocopt>=0.6.2\nNoteAnsible will also install a number of its own dependancies.Initialise k8sdcBefore installing k8sdc, a directory needs to be initialised with the files for a particular Provider.  The following example uses Vagrant as the Provider.$ mkdir ~/k8sdc\n$ cd ~/k8sdc\n$ k8sdc init -p vagrant\nNoteTo install using the Vagrant Provider the following software versions must be installed.Vagrant 1.8.4\n\nVirtualbox 5.0.26 and above\n\nEdit the provider.yaml fileIf you wish to change the install defaults then you can review and edit the provider.yaml file that has been created in the install root directory.TODOGenerate public / private key pair for admin userYou can generate your own public / private key pair for the admin user or make use of the sample ones provided.  The key pair can be found in the keys/ directory of the install root.TODOInstall the base componentsThe simplest way to install the k8sdc base components is by using k8sdc up.$ k8sdc up\nNoteThe default installation directory for the kubectl and helm commands is in the bin/ directory of the install root.Validate the installOnce k8sdc up has completed you should have a working installation of the k8sdc base components.  To test this use the following commands.$ export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/config/kubectl.kubeconfig\n$ bin/kubectl get nodes\nYou should see the set of Kubernetes hosts, i.e.NAME                STATUS    AGE\nnode1.vb.k8sdc.io   Ready     5m\nnode2.vb.k8sdc.io   Ready     5m\nnode3.vb.k8sdc.io   Ready     5m\nInstall the SolutionsOnce the k8sdc base components are installed the Solutions can be applied.For the moment you will need to create a new Namespace.

This is a a known Vagrant issue with the rpcbind service and it does not happen when using Digital Ocean.  To remedy this the vagrant_restart_fix.sh should be run after each restart of Vagrant.$ cd utilities\n\n$ ./vagrant_restart_fix.sh\nHosts File SetupThis utility sets up the local /etc/hosts file to include the k8sdc services FQDNs.Note, you will be asked for your root password.$ cd utilities\n\n$ ./hosts_file_setup.sh\n"},"reference/changelog.html":{"url":"reference/changelog.html","title":"Changelog","keywords":"","body":"Changelog"},"reference/glossary.html":{"url":"reference/glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"GlossaryInfrastructureIn the context of k8sdc this means ...DevelopmentIn the context of k8sdc this means ...ProductivityIn the context of k8sdc this means ...CapabilitySolutionProductToolBase ComponentProviderA Provider describes the machine level platform that the k8sdc components can be deployed to.

However some products have paid versions.  If you find a product particularly useful I recommend paying for it to help maintain the continued development of the product.Why have you created this project?To allow for smaller organisations to more easily innovate on digital content.  To allow organisations to regain control of their IT.  To minimise the cost barrier when providing digital content.  To democratize access to professional capabilities without being locked into a particular vendor.Do you make money from k8sdc?Not from k8sdc itself. However, money might be made in providing consulting services at some point in the future.  And there may also be a paid product that adds additional value.  Although this is not a given.  Most importantly though, k8sdc will always be free.Is this a silver bullet to all my IT needs?No.  k8sdc makes it quick and easy to bootstrap a set of IT Capabilities.  However, to fully understand and learn how to use all of these Capabilities will take considerable time and effort. Also, the provided Solutions may not suit your requirements.  Meaning customisation will be needed.What if there is a feature that I really need?You are free to integrate your own Solutions.  If the Solution could be useful to the community, and it does not compromise your business activity, then please consider making a pull request and contributing it back to k8sdc.What does fully integrated 'out of the box' mean?Where can I run k8sdc?UsageHow do I upgrade the version of Kubernetes?How do I add my k8sdc installation files to Git?First, create a Git repository.  Then get the remote URL and run the following commands inside the k8sdc installation directory.$ git init\n$ git remote add \n$ git add -A\n$ git commit -m \"Initial commit”\n"}}}
